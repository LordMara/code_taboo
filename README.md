## code taboo - part 1

Implement application with mentor and student sides for managing events in Codecool.
* Mentor should have option to book checkpoint
* Student should have option to book private mentoring session
* Student should have option to see all events he/she participate

## code taboo - part 2

### Before your second Checkpoint you should be familiar with OOP issues. For better practicing your OOP skills, take your code taboo and improve it step by step:

1. Refactor all scripts.
2. Make it fool-proof.
3. Add more functionalities to application:

- reading and saving events details to .csv file
- choice of preferred mentor from the list for private mentoring session
- setting a goal of a private mentoring session
- cancelation of event
- rescheduling an event
- Adapt the application for mentor, who can see all events of all students and is able to cancel an event.

## Good luck!
